# Reminders App

"In iOS 6, Apple released an API that allows you to add entries to the Reminders app that was introduced in iOS 5. With this new API, your apps can interact directly with this great utility and build features that automatically creat reminders relevant to your users."

Here is an app that creates reminders with two different types of alarms: time-based and location-based.
